# QUICKTELLER App

## Project Description

This project is a teller app that allows for a teller to quickly complete transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and account inquiries. The teller can also open and close accounts through the app. I wrote the program using Python and saved the account information using a CSV and MongoDB.
